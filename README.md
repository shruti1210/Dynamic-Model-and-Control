# Dynamic-Model-and-Control

1. Developed using MATLAB

2. Developed a dynamic model of a 2-DOF RR manipulator with joint flexibility : theory explained in the "Sop_report.pdf"

3. Final.mlx is used to derive the dynamic response of the system in response to input torque. 

4. Later a PID controller is designed in model_euler.slx fille on the above derived system.
