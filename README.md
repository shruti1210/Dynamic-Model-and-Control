# Dynamic-Model-and-Control
Developed using MATLAB
Developed a dynamic model of a 2-DOF RR manipulator with joint flexibility : theory explained in the "Sop_report.pdf"
Final.mlx is used to dervie the dynamic response of the system in response to input torque. 
Later a PID controller is designed in model_euler.slx fille on the above derived system.
